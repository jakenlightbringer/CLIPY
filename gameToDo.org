#+Title: Ganes To Do

* Large Needs
** Encapsulation
create a module (file) for each of the enemies that will be included in the game as well as player. Call these rather than calling the build enemy. 
This will add in the ability to have the player and enemy spells within the Class itself

THINK FACTORIO 
*** Varibles
make the hard coded values variables rather than hard coded values within the encapsulated modules

** Enums
Have enums within the player input rather than stirng inputs

* Classes

** Character Class
baseHP
baseDefense
baseAttack
baseSP
*** Player Class (Character)
name
playableClassSelection
